🚗 Road Accident Severity & Hospital Recommendation using Deep Learning
This project, developed in collaboration with Edugene Techno Services, Hyderabad, aims to predict the severity of road accidents and provide hospital recommendations using deep learning techniques. It demonstrates a powerful application of AI in public safety and emergency response.

🧠 Project Objective
To create an intelligent system that:

Predicts the severity level of a road accident based on input features such as location, weather, time, and vehicle details.

Recommends the nearest hospital suitable for the predicted severity, ensuring timely medical intervention.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

TensorFlow / Keras – for building and training the deep learning model

Pandas / NumPy / Scikit-learn – for data preprocessing and analysis

Geolocation libraries – for identifying nearby hospitals (based on coordinates)

Jupyter Notebook – for experimentation and implementation

📊 Project Highlights
Local dataset-based prediction without requiring external databases

Multi-class classification of accident severity (e.g., Minor, Moderate, Severe)

Hospital suggestion logic based on proximity and accident severity

Fine-tuned model for improved prediction accuracy
